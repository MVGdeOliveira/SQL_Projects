In this exercise, the data analyst should work with the business intelligence (BI) department of Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a fictive global movie rental company. The company plans to launch an online video rental service and wants to have an analysis to contribute to that.

The Management Board asked some business questions to use in the 2020 company strategy:

  ● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
  
  ● What was the average rental duration for all videos?
  
  ● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
  
  ● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
  
  ● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
